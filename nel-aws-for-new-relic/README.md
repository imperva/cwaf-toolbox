# Imperva NEL

This project contains source code and supporting files for a serverless application that you can deploy with the SAM CLI. It includes the following files and folders.

- hello_world - Code for the application's Lambda function.
- events - Invocation events that you can use to invoke the function.
- tests - Unit tests for the application code. 
- template.yaml - A template that defines the application's AWS resources.

The application uses several AWS resources, including Lambda functions, API Gateway API, Kinesis Stream and Firehose, and Secret Manager. You can update the template to add AWS resources through the same deployment process that updates your application code.
